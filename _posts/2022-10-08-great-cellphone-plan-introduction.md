### Introduction

- Wireless Status
  Each phone number can be distinguished by wireless status. The mobile phone numbers are wireless Y, and the lindline numbers are wireless N. The wireless N numbers have lots of limits in registering account. Some companies like bank, google will not allow users to use wireless N numbers to registering accounts. Here is a check [website](https://freecarrierlookup.com). The status cannot be set, but it is related to your plan. You can change to wireless plan to change this.
- Caller ID
  Caller ID reduces unidentified calls by displaying a caller's information, even if they're not in your contact list. Here is a check [website](https://apeiron.io/cnam). This can be set by the phone plan provider, but not every provider allows set it or free to set it.
- Do Not Call
