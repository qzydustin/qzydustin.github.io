Running a BitTorrent (BT) or Private Tracker (PT) server at home can be challenging if your home network doesn’t have a public IP. Public IPs are essential for direct peer-to-peer connections, which significantly improve torrent connectivity. However, with the right setup, you can achieve similar connectivity and even gain extra benefits, like access to IPv6 peers, by using a VPS and WireGuard.

This guide will show you how to set up WireGuard on a VPS to relay torrent traffic to your home server, effectively giving your home server a “public” presence through the VPS.

## Why a Public IP is Important for BT/PT

In torrenting, the ability to connect to other peers is crucial:
- **Peers with a Public IP**: These can establish connections freely with both public and private peers, improving performance.
- **Peers with a Private IP**: These are limited to connecting to public peers, which reduces connectivity.
- **Full Private Setup**: When both the seeder and leecher lack a public IP, they cannot connect to each other, leading to connectivity issues and poorer performance.

If your home network doesn’t have a public IP, your torrents might struggle to establish connections. This is especially problematic on private trackers, where connectivity affects both download speed and upload ratios.

## Solution: Use a VPS with WireGuard

To bypass the need for a public IP on your home server, we’ll use a VPS. The VPS will:
- **Provide unlimited bandwidth** if possible (ideal for torrenting)
- **Run WireGuard VPN**, securely forwarding connections to your home server as if it had a public IP

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Set Up WireGuard on Your VPS

First, configure WireGuard on your VPS to act as a bridge between your torrent peers and your home server. Below is a sample configuration for the WireGuard server (`/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`) on the VPS:

```ini
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.1/24, 2001:db8::1/64
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = <VPS_Private_Key>

# Forward TCP/UDP traffic on ports 30000-39999 to the home server
PostUp = iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 30000:39999 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2
PostUp = iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 30000:39999 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2
PostUp = iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostUp = ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 30000:39999 -j DNAT --to-destination [2001:db8::2]
PostUp = ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 30000:39999 -j DNAT --to-destination [2001:db8::2]
PostUp = ip6tables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

PostDown = iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 30000:39999 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p udp --dport 30000:39999 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = ip6tables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 30000:39999 -j DNAT --to-destination [2001:db8::2]
PostDown = ip6tables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p udp --dport 30000:39999 -j DNAT --to-destination [2001:db8::2]
PostDown = ip6tables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

[Peer]
PublicKey = <Home_Server_Public_Key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32, 2001:db8::2/128
```

This setup allows the VPS to route all traffic directed to ports 30000-39999 to your home server, enabling your torrent client to operate as if it has a public IP.

### 2. Set Up WireGuard on Your Home Server

Next, configure WireGuard on your home server to connect to the VPS’s WireGuard network and assign it an IP within that range.

```ini
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.2/24, 2001:db8::2/64
PrivateKey = <Home_Server_Private_Key>

[Peer]
PublicKey = <VPS_Public_Key>
Endpoint = <VPS_IP>:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
```

This configuration tunnels all traffic through the VPS, making your home server appear to have the VPS’s public IP to the outside world.

### 3. Configure Your Torrent Client

- Set the listening port range in your torrent client (e.g., qBittorrent) to `30000-39999`.
- **Avoid configuring a proxy** in your torrent client. Setting a proxy can cause the reported port to appear as `0`, preventing incoming connections.

Once configured, your torrent client will route all active download and seeding traffic through the WireGuard tunnel. This setup provides privacy and security, as other peers will only see the VPS’s IP.

## Additional Benefit: Access to IPv6 Peers via WireGuard

A major bonus of using WireGuard with a VPS is the ability to connect to IPv6 peers, even if your home network lacks IPv6 support. Most VPS providers offer IPv6 by default, meaning that your torrent client on the home server can connect to IPv6 peers through the VPS’s IPv6 address.

Connecting through IPv6 is beneficial because:
- **Increased Peer Connectivity**: More torrent peers use IPv6, improving download and upload rates.
- **Better Performance**: IPv6 networks are often less congested and can bypass certain restrictions, giving smoother connectivity.

In our configuration, the IPv6 addresses `[2001:db8::1]` on the VPS and `[2001:db8::2]` on your home server allow the torrent client to connect with IPv6 peers, even if your ISP doesn’t provide IPv6 natively.

## Summary

By setting up WireGuard on a VPS, you can bypass the lack of a public IP on your home server, enabling seamless BT/PT usage. This setup:
- Allows direct connections with public peers, improving upload/download speeds.
- Enhances privacy, as your IP remains hidden behind the VPS.
- Enables IPv6 connectivity, offering additional peer connections and smoother performance.

With these steps, you can enjoy a robust and private torrenting experience from your home server, without the limitations of a private IP.
